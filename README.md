# 5008_GroupDataStructures
Group project for CS 5008

Welcome to our readme for our project for CS5008! This readme contains a file with a list of contents in our repo, and a list of identified areas for future testing for this project.

CONTENTS:

Final_Report...pdf: This contains a pdf of our final report, with reasearch on both of the trees and areas for potential overlap.

Final_Presentation...pdf: This contains a visual aid for presenting the content in the report.

kdTree.c: Our implementation of a k-d tree.

trie.c: One implementation of a trie.

trie_rb.c: Another implementation of a trie.

trie_rb_commandline.c: A command line program to perform basic operations on a trie.

AREAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT (in no particular order)
1. Continuing work on our trie command line program
2. Creating a k-d tree for higher levels of k
3. Creating a k-d tree for a customizable k
4. Develop and implement tests toward a customizable keyboard: create a k-d tree where k=26 (for the letters in the alphabet)
5. Develop and implement tests toward a AI autocorrect predictor
